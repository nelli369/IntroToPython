Import the math package. Now you can access the constant pi with math.pi.
Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in C.
Calculate the area of the circle and store it in A.

# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Import the math package

import math

# Calculate C
C = 2* math.pi * r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * r **2

# Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))

Perform a selective import from the math package where you only import the radians function.
Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit.
 Assign the result to dist. You can calculate this as r * phi, where r is 
the radius and phi is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, 
use the radians() function, which you just imported.
Print out dist.

# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians

# Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist.
phi = radians(12)
dist = r * phi

# Print out dist
print(dist)

Different ways of importing
There are several ways to import packages and modules into Python.
 Depending on the import call, you'll have to use different Python code.

Suppose you want to use the function inv(), 
which is in the linalg subpackage of the scipy package. 
You want to be able to use this function as follows:

my_inv([[1,2], [3,4]])
Which import statement will you need in order to run the above code without an error?
